name: to-claude
description: Hand this conversation to Claude Code so the user can keep going there. The first time it is imported and linked; after that the linked Claude conversation is opened. Use when the user says $to-claude, "switch to claude", "continue in claude", 切到 claude, 转给 claude, or is running out of Codex usage. Also when the user says "unlink", "stop syncing" or 取消关联.

# Continue in Claude

This skill uses the `ccx` command from the ccx app (github.com/aaronwong1999/ccx). If `~/.local/bin/ccx` doesn't exist, tell the user to install ccx with `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronwong1999/ccx/main/install.sh | sh` and stop.

1. If a change is half-written, finish or stop it cleanly first. Don't leave broken files.
2. If you have a task list, make sure it's up to date: it travels with the conversation.
3. Run `~/.local/bin/ccx call codex send_current_session -C "<current working directory>"`. It reads Claude's and Codex's local session data and opens the Claude app, so if the sandbox blocks it, ask to run it outside the sandbox.
4. Reply with one sentence about the result. Then stop editing, so the two apps don't change files at the same time. When the user sends a message on the Claude side, this side's progress goes with it.

If the user says "unlink", "stop syncing", 取消关联 or 不要同步了, run `~/.local/bin/ccx call codex unlink -C "<current working directory>"`. It forgets the link to the Claude conversation, so neither side gets the other's progress any more; both conversations are kept, and handing over again links them afresh.
