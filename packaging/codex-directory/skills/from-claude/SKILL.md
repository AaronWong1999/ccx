name: from-claude
description: Continue, in this conversation, a task that was being worked on in Claude Code. The first time it imports and links the Claude session; after that it only brings over new progress. Use when the user says $from-claude, "continue from claude", "import the … session from claude", "sync with claude", "what did claude get done", 接着 claude 继续, 从 claude 把…导入, or shares a screenshot of a Claude session and asks to continue it.

# Continue from Claude

This skill uses the `ccx` command from the ccx app (github.com/aaronwong1999/ccx). If `~/.local/bin/ccx` doesn't exist, tell the user to install ccx with `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronwong1999/ccx/main/install.sh | sh` and stop. Run every `ccx` command below with `-C "<current working directory>"`; it reads local session files, so if the sandbox blocks it, ask to run it outside the sandbox.

1. **The user named the session** (a title, some words from it, or a screenshot): run `~/.local/bin/ccx call codex continue_here --query "<name>"`. Every project is searched.
   - Pick the candidate whose title matches best and run `~/.local/bin/ccx call codex continue_here --session-id <id>`.
   - If several look equally likely, list up to 5 (number, title, updated, folder if different) and let the user choose.
2. **The user did not name one** ("continue from claude", "sync"): run `~/.local/bin/ccx call codex continue_here`.
   - Already linked: you get Claude's new progress.
   - Not linked yet: you get candidates; choose as in step 1.
3. With the `<ccx-sync>` block in hand, tell the user in one sentence what came over, then **carry on with their task right here**. Treat the block as work you did yourself; the files on disk are the source of truth.
   - If it shows a **task list**, continue from its first unfinished item.
   - If it says the other side **stopped in the middle of a step**, first check whether that step finished, then continue.
4. **Different folder**: if the block has a "NOTE: … folder" line, tell the user and ask whether to continue in that folder or use the progress only as reference. Never edit the other folder on your own.
5. To get Claude's newer progress later, run step 2 again. (With the full ccx install, new progress also arrives on its own with each message.)
